# Cellular-Automata-Heat-Diffusion

- We have implemented the heat diffusion in various scenarios.
- In question 2, we have implemented absorbing, periodic and reflecting boundaries.
- In question 3, we have implemented weighted diffusion for different boundaries.
- In question 4, we observe and compare the tempreture in the center and corner of the grid for absorbing boundary.
- .ipynb file contains the code through which we have generated the results and animation clips.
